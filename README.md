# PredictiveAnalyticsFinalProject
In this project, a dataset from Spotify was used to predict whether any of the supplied variables were predictive of a song's popularity. Both linear regression and KNN modeling were used to test the data. After analysis, it was found that the variables (tempo, key, acousticness, danceability, time signature, etc.) were NOT predictive of a song's popularity.
